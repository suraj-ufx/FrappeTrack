# FrappeTrack

FrappeTrack is a desktop-based time tracking application built using **Frappe**, **ERPNext**, and **Electron**.

The app allows users to track time spent on tasks directly from their desktop with simple **Start, Pause, and Stop** controls. While tracking is active, the application captures screenshots at random intervals to provide work context and transparency.

Once tracking is stopped, the recorded time, selected task details, and captured screenshots are automatically synced to **ERPNext Timesheets**, ensuring accurate and centralized time records.

FrappeTrack is designed for teams and organizations that use ERPNext and need a seamless, secure, and efficient way to monitor task-based work time, with future support for activity tracking and productivity insights.
